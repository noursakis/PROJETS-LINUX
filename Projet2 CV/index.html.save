                interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is
                <b>fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the <a href="/manual">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
                package was installed on this server.

          </p>
          <p>
                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Debian systems is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>

        <div class="content_section_text">
            <p>
                By default, Debian does not allow access through the web browser to
                <em>any</em> file apart of those located in <tt>/var/www</tt>,
                <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_userdir.html" rel="nofollow">public_html</a>
                directories (when enabled) and <tt>/usr/share</tt> (for web
                applications). If your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in <tt>/srv</tt>) you may need to whitelist your
                document root directory in <tt>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</tt>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The default Debian document root is <tt>/var/www/html</tt>. You
                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section_header">
          <div id="bugs"></div>

        <div class="content_section_text">

                Please use the <tt>reportbug</tt> tool to report bugs in the
                Apache2 package with Debian. However, check <a
                href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?ordering=normal;archive=0;src=apache2;repeatmerged=0"

          <p>
                Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)
                to respective packages, not to the web server itself.
